precision,recall, F1 score

â€” nice simple linear regression example calling fminunc
-  learning curve - plots training and cross validation error as a function of training set size
- Polynomial regress - converting to a higher order polynomial i.e. given x (Scalar), convert to higher degrees of x 
- feature normalization
- This chapter has a great video on precision and recall (no code, only video). When classes are skewed, precision and recall are better ways for measuring accuracy than summary statistics.
- F1 Score- summary statistic rather than 2 i.e. precision and recall
- Good math behind why F score is chosen over an average of precision + recall
